# Code Breaker!

This is a console application for the game Code Breaker.
There are many versions of this game, so here are the rules:
- At the start, a 4 digit secret code is randomly generated.
- Each digit in the number is unique! (1234 is valid, but 7789 is not.)
- The player has 8 chances to guess the secret code.
- The player will be given hints after each incorrect guess:
    - How many digits were guessed correctly
    - How many digits were guessed with the correct number, but in the wrong place.
- If the player guesses the code correctly, they win!
- If the player runs out of guesses, they lose!

If the player loses, they can either play again or exit the application.
